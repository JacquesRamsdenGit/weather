# Weather Application Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the development of a modern weather application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application will provide users with current weather conditions, 3-day forecasts, and 7-day forecasts using open-source weather data from the Open-Meteo API. The UI design will follow modern design principles with a clean, intuitive interface that emphasizes visual data presentation, drawing inspiration from the theme provided in the UI examples folder.
