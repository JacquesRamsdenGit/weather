# üê≥ PRODUCTION CONTAINERIZATION TEMPLATE
# This is an EXAMPLE template that gets REPLACED during framework implementation
# The AI agent will DELETE this file and create production-ready CI/CD workflows

name: "[TEMPLATE] Production Container Pipeline"
# This workflow is DISABLED and serves as a template only
# The framework will generate actual production workflows that:
# ‚úÖ Build optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles for each service
# ‚úÖ Push to container registries with semantic versioning
# ‚úÖ Include security scanning and vulnerability assessments
# ‚úÖ Support multi-service matrix builds for microservices
# ‚úÖ Implement rollback procedures and health checks
# ‚úÖ Clean up this template file upon completion

# TEMPLATE STATUS: This file will be DELETED during implementation
# REPLACEMENT: Production workflows will be created in:
# - .github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml (main pipeline)
# - .github/workflows/security-scan.yml (security checks)
# - .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml (linting, testing)

# FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# The AI agent will analyze the project and generate workflows that include:
# 1. Service detection and matrix builds for microservices
# 2. Technology-specific optimizations (Node.js, .NET, Python)
# 3. Environment-specific deployments (dev/staging/prod)
# 4. Integration with cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP)
# 5. Monitoring and observability setup
# 6. Automated rollback procedures
